* The pairs should be randomly positioned before a new game starts.

* There should be a replay button to restart the game when finished.

* The project should look, feel and work similarly in Google Chrome and Firefox.

* The project can't contain any errors, warning or notices in the developer console.

* The project should only be written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
